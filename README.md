Circuit of Mana (for UGDK)
==========================

This is a prototype of our Circuit of Mana project using UGDK.

How to Compile
--------------

### On Linux

You need the following packages:

  ```
  cmake >= 2.8.11
  git >= 1.7.10
  ```

After cloning this repository, go inside its root directory and use the commands:

  ```bash
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  ```

It generates an executable for each POV version of the prototype:

  ```
  src/platformer/circuit-of-mana-platformer
  ```
